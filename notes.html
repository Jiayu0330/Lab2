      <dt>Sheathe your sword, draw your deck, and get ready for Hearthstone - the fast-paced strategy card game that's easy to learn and massively fun. Start a free game and play your cards to sling spells, summon creatures, and command the heroes of Warcraft in duels of epic strategy.</dt>
      <dt>Tips for New Players</dt>
      <dt>Don’t overextend yourself</dt>
      <dd>Don’t play more cards than you need to, especially if you have already gained a significant lead over your opponent. You never know when she may draw a card that turns the tides, and you’ll need a full hand then.</dd>
      <dt>Don’t overbuff</dt>
      <dd>Buff cards can be powerful, but if you have a ton of buffs in your deck and only a few minions to play them on you’ll be a sitting duck. Likewise, if you keep buffing the same minion over and over, you risk turning it into a lightning rod – a magnet for removal spells.</dd>
      <dt>Don’t waste damage spells</dt>
      <dd>Casting Arcane missiles on the first turn when all it can do is 3 measly damage to your opponent is a waste of a great card. Wait until you have an opportunity to make a good trade with these cards.</dd>
      <dt>Don’t try to be too clever with your deck</dt>
      <dd>If you build your deck with a ton of combinations in there, you’re that much more likely to run into problems if you don’t draw the right cards in the right order. Focus on a few strong synergies and a solid overall strategy instead.</dd>
      <dt>Don’t hang on to your cards for too long</dt>
      <dd>Now that I’ve told you not to overplay your hand and not to waste your spells, I’m going to tell you to also not sit on your cards for too long. If you have a spell or a minion that can get you the advantage now, use it!</dd>
