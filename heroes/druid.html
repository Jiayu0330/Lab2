        <li><font color="black" size="5">"Versatility is the name of the game for Malfurion (well, no, it's technically still Hearthstone, but you get what we're saying). Many of his spells can have one of two effects, and even some of his minions can shapeshift to meet the tactical needs of the moment. He can generate mana quickly and even leapfrog his opponent, allowing Malfurion to bring powerful damage spells and board clears to bear. Heh. Bear.)"</font></li>
