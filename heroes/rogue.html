        <li>Valeera Sanguinar</li>
        <li>Rogues are masters of sneak attacks, tradecraft, and subterfuge, and Valeera is no exception. Not only does her deck include excellent direct damage spells and potent removal abilities, her cards can also combo off each other for deadly effect. To make matters worse (for her opponents), her ability to summon a dagger means that in a pinch this nimble rogue can easily take matters into her own hands."</li>
