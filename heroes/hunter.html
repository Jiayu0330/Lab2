Her decks include plenty of direct damage spells she will gleefully hurl at her opponents, including some very potent board clears like Arcane Explosion and Flamestrike. Add to that a Hero Power that makes short work of small minions and a varied assortment of Secrets, and you've got yourself a versatile, deadly opponent."</li>
