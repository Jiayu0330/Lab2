        <li>"When it comes to turning mana into OH GOD IT BURNS, Jaina is second to none. Her decks include plenty of direct damage spells she will gleefully hurl at her opponents, including some very potent board clears like Arcane Explosion and Flamestrike. Add to that a Hero Power that makes short work of small minions and a varied assortment of Secrets, and you've got yourself a versatile, deadly opponent."</li>
